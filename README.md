Check out this [blog post](https://dgraph.io/blog/post/todo-slash-graphql/) to learn more about getting started with Slash GraphQL, or head over to our [docs](https://graphql.dgraph.io/) to get started.

## Starting the App

```
npm install
npm start
```

You'll first need to set the url in `src/index.js` to the Slash GraphQL backend that you deploy.  See the instructions in the blog to get started.

## Dependencies

The UI is vanilla React JS with Apollo client, and the neat [React-TodoMVC](https://github.com/sw-yx/react-todomvc) component.
