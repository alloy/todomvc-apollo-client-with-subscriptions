# TodoMVC: Apollo Client with subscriptions

A TodoMVC implementation that leverages Apollo Client, created by [Dgraph Labs](https://github.com/dgraph-io/tudo-tutorial). It is updated to use a plain local JS GraphQL server and adds subscriptions.

## Running the app locally

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

## Dependencies

The UI is vanilla React JS with Apollo client, and the neat [React-TodoMVC](https://github.com/sw-yx/react-todomvc) component.
